### What is Docker?

--

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a containerization tool used for spinning up isolated, reproducible application environments.

--

1. **Lightweight** - uses the host computer's processes (check out [Containers are not VMs](https://blog.docker.com/2016/03/containers-are-not-vms/))
1. **VCS** - Version control system for infrastructure
1. **Distribution** - Easily distribute and recreate your entire development environment
1. **Build once, run anywhere** (aka, The Holy Grail!) - no more environment-specific bugs

<br>

---

### Install Docker

https://www.docker.com/community-edition

```sh
$ docker -v
Docker version 17.06.2-ce, build cec0b72
```

--

Obligatory 'Hello, World':

```sh
$ docker run hello-world
```

<img src="images/hello-world.png" alt="hello world" style="width:150px;">

---

### Concepts

https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/

- **[Dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/glossary/?term=Dockerfile)** - scripts with a set of instructions used to create an *image*.

--

- **[Images](https://docs.docker.com/glossary/?term=image)** - are used to build and save snapshots (the state) of an environment. It's blueprint for a *container*.

  > **NOTE:** You can think of an image as a virtual operating system, but smaller and more efficient.

--

- **[Container](https://docs.docker.com/glossary/?term=container)** is an instantiated, live *image* that runs a collection of processes.

### Dockerfile Basics

https://github.com/mjhea0/docker-workshop/blob/master/locations/Dockerfile:

```sh
FROM node:latest

# set working directory
RUN mkdir /usr/src/app
WORKDIR /usr/src

# add `/usr/src/node_modules/.bin` to $PATH
ENV PATH /usr/src/node_modules/.bin:$PATH

# install and cache app dependencies
ADD package.json /usr/src/package.json
RUN npm install

# add files and folders to the container
ADD /app /usr/src/app

# start app
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

--

Be sure to take advantage of Docker‚Äôs layered [caching](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/#build-cache) system, to speed up build times, by adding the *package.json* and installing the dependencies **before** adding the app‚Äôs source files.

---

### Build an Image

Within the "locations" directory, run:

```sh
$ docker build -t "locations" .
```

--

**What's happening?**

Docker pulls down the base [Node](https://hub.docker.com/_/node/) image found on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), an [image registry](https://docs.docker.com/registry/) (it's like GitHub for Docker Images). From there, each line, called a [layer](https://docs.docker.com/glossary/?term=layer), from the Dockerfile is run and added to the new image.

> **NOTE:** The first time you build an image, it will take some time. Subsequent builds should be *much* faster since layers are cached locally - only layers that change will be updated.

--

Run `docker images` to view the newly created image.

--

You can also add a version to the tag name:

```sh
$ docker build -t "locations:v2" .
```

---

### Run the Image

To run the `locations` image:

```sh
$ docker run -d -p 80:1337 locations
```

- `-p` connects port 1337 of the Docker container to port 80 of your machine
- `-d` runs the container in the background

> **NOTE:** Instead of localhost (127.0.0.1), this could also be the IP associated with Docker Machine - `docker-machine ip MACHINE_NAME`.

--

Helpful commands for running containers:

1. View: `docker ps`
1. Stop: `docker stop CONTAINER_ID`
1. View the logs: `docker logs CONTAINER_ID -f`
1. Enter bash: `docker exec -it CONTAINER_ID bash`
1. Run tests: `docker exec -it CONTAINER_ID npm test`

--

To pass an environment variable at run-time:

```sh
$ docker run -d -p 80:1338 -e PORT=1338 locations
```

---

### Docker Compose Basics

https://github.com/mjhea0/docker-workshop/blob/master/locations-db/docker-compose.yml

--

This file is used by [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to link multiple services together. With one command it will spin up the defined services and enable them to communicate with one another.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37966552/what-is-the-difference-between-docker-and-docker-compose

<br>

<img src="images/docker-compose.png" alt="docker compose logo" style="width:200px;">

---

### Database Service

From *docker-compose.yml* within "locations-db":

```yaml
locations-db:
  container_name: locations-db
  build: ./app/db
  ports:
    - '5433:5432'
  environment:
    - POSTGRES_USER=admin
    - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=admin
  healthcheck:
    test: exit 0
```

Here, we create a new container called `locations-db`, from the Dockerfile found in "locations-db/app/db". We also add environment variables, expose ports, and send an exit code of `0` once it is successfully up and running - which will be used by other services.

---

### Node Service

From *docker-compose.yml*:

```yaml
locations-service:
  container_name: locations-service
  build: .
  volumes:
    - './app:/usr/src/app'
    - './package.json:/usr/src/package.json'
    - './knexfile.js:/usr/src/knexfile.js'
  ports:
    - '1337:1337'
  environment:
    - DATABASE_URL=postgres://admin:admin@locations-db:5432/locations_dev
    - DATABASE_TEST_URL=postgres://admin:admin@locations-db:5432/locations_test
    - NODE_ENV=development
  depends_on:
    locations-db:
      condition: service_healthy
  links:
    - locations-db
```

**What‚Äôs new here?**

1. [volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/) - mount directories into a container so that you can make changes to the code without having to build a new image.
1. [depends_on](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#depends_on) - used to start services in a specific order.
1. [links](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#links) - connect services together.

---

### Build and Run

Build the images:

```sh
$ docker-compose build
```

Run the containers:

```sh
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Migrate and seed:

```sh
$ docker-compose run locations-service knex migrate:latest \
          --env development --knexfile knexfile.js
$ docker-compose run locations-service knex seed:run \
          --env development --knexfile knexfile.js
```

Test:

```sh
$ docker-compose run locations-service npm test
```

---

### Workflow

Some commands...

**Check env variables:**

```sh
$ docker-compose run locations-service env
```

**Force new build**:

```sh
$ docker-compose build --no-cache
```

**Stop running containers**:

```sh
$ docker-compose stop
```

**Enter psql**:

```sh
$ docker exec -ti locations-db psql -U admin -W
```
